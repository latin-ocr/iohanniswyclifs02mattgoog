XVIII INTRODUCTION.

Thus in one passage he says: If the Church were deprived ol sacramenta
and sacramental usages, it would not perish for that, lor the Christian
needs only to believe in God and observe His law. To him Christ
the Saviour is Pope, bishop and priest, and He has power to bestow
salvation without these superfluous symbols.

Often transubstantation is discussed¹ and the passages are fairly
numerous, in which he expresses his convictions about miracles,
adoration of the saints and canonisations.

Satan, he says, can deceive tuen much more easily by miracles
of the dead, than by holiness of the living.²

By these false miracles the Church can easily be deceived3 one
nowhere reads that John the Baptist worked miracles, though by the
testimony of Christ Himself, amongst mortals nobody was greater
than St. Johnt So the miracles at the tomb of St. Thomas may even
have been caused by the devil.⁴ God did not will that honour should
be pnid to the body ol Moses, nor to that ol the Holy virgin, nor
ol the evangelist St. John; the Bible establishes nothing at all about
the adoration of saints, and this being the case, men sin, who disobey
so lar the commandment ol the Church triumphant.⁵ Truly pinus
men dislilte earthly praise and this is also the reason why the Saints
abhor canonisations, which are often false; they abhor the leasts,⁸
which are multiplied out of worldly motives, and deprive of their
lavour those who keep them in this spirit.⁷ Neither by pilgrimnges,
nor by noisy adoration ol the saints and their relies shall we reach
our goal. The saints must be venerated with wisdom; and this is
done best by giving away the finery ol the dead to the poor. But
verily he who tells the people this, is condemned as a heretic.

The magnificent architecture ol ehurches, not to speak ol
monasteries‚ is severely blamed. They do not incite to piety, but they
divert from it3 they do not prove humility, but the insupportable
pride ol the clergy. Of the mendicant lriars, Wyclil says, that in

their haughtiness they build mighty houses and towers like the tower
