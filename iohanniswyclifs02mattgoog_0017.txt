XIV INTRODUCTION.

So they delude the world, and try to make it believe that whoever
wears a cowl, must needs be a good clergyman.

Useless for defending God’s cause, and following their carnal
instincts, they only care how to satisfy their ambition, and their greed
for worldly pleasures and enjoyments.

They either idle about in the palaces of the ruling lords or
scour the villages and provinces, trying to extott their prey by any
means; so they collect their stores, and live like worldly lords; and
in spite of all this they say, that they follow the example of Christ
more than others. But by searching ever so carefully, hardly oue
mendicant friar will be found, who acts according to Christ's doctrine
and example. They like to accept bishopries because they are lucrative3
not like St. John the Baptist clad in skins, but in soft clothiug‚ they
live in kings’ houses and hate to reside in the cloister. They not
only contribute nothing to the peace of their sellun-creatures, but
they stir up quarrel aud hatred, because they prosper best by it; and
as the nest of the Roman church is their last refuge, they defend it,
3ηά whoever speaks against it, is reviled as a heretic and despised.

From these last remarks, it is evident that Wyclil entered into
conflict with the mendicant friars not only because they accused him
of heresy for his doctrine of the Lord's supper, but because he con·
sidered them the most flexible instruments of Romish absolutism,
and the principal defenders of all ecclesiastical errors 3ηά abuses.¹

Therefore in speaking of the errors of his time, the ecclesiastical
abuses‚ the sins and pretensions of the clergy‚ and so on, he treats
it all from the point of view of the contest with the mendicant lriars.
And this may be the reason why he, who formerly did not much
esteem the endowed orders and blamed them severely for their faults‚
now believes them to be on the whole better than the mendicant
friars. Therefore he discusses at length in oue of the following
sermons the question: who is the worse, the monk (member of an
endowed order) or the mendicant friar.2 Although neither live after
the christian order³ — it would be easier ou the whole to lead back
