INTRODUCTION. XIX

But God despises such buildings and also the Apostle did not
permit such buildings or other monuments, not sanctioned by the
lloly Scriptum, to be erected.¹ The grand palaces and houses ol the
mendicant lriars‚ he compares to dens ol robbers. Whilst the monks
build cloisters like casdes, the mendicant lriars make themselves
residences like robber's dens.

As ol old, Cain built the first town, not sor the protection ol
the inhabitants ol the country, but to conceal his prey, so now do
the lriars. They build houses and churches in order to deceive the
people who bring them alms, and to conceal their prey. And lor this
building ol churches they erroneously cite the example of Solomon.²

ln one passage it is questioned, whether these buildings ol the
monks and clergy are of any good at all to the Church.

“And it appears'’, Wyclil says, “lrom this gospel (Matth. XXIV, 3),
that Christ‘condemned such buildings both by deed and word. They
are neither virtuous in themselves, nor do they incite to virtue. ll
they cto, it must he because their beauty augments devotion, but
what reason is there to believe this? Did not the martyra pray more
devoutly in the dungeon? Did not John the Baptist reach ol loltier

they were well aware that God is omnipresent; and in churches
man’s mind is diverted very much by earthly things. The building ol
churches often leads to the contrary ol what has been intended. lt
swallows the property ol the Church and produces manilold errors,
on account of the many human inventione and innovations connected
with it. Why, l ask, should the Church care for the lorrn of friars',
churches why for the form ol their cloister, why for the appearance
of refectories and sleeping rooms with many other things, which have
been smuggled in after the manner of the pharisees; since we know,
that not these outward signs but the pure mind of the man who
meditates on Christ’s sufferings, and the soul raised to God in humble
reverence, make the place a holy one? What have we to do with
