to it the monks than the mendicant friars; which he then explains
in detail.¹

There is more sin in connexion with these mendicant orders,
than in connexion with secular government; for the divine command·
ment concerning the distribution of goods, as it was in the state of
innocence‚ as the Apostles practised it and asit answers the interests
of the state, is most transgressed by the orders. These orders are
possessors in amore exact sense than anybody else. Whilst secular
lords return their property, either in life, or at death, to the world‚²
it accumulates with the monks, and it is not to be wondered at that
they care for worldly things more than the secular lords dn.

ln this confusion a change must be effected3 and as the clerical
arm fails, the secular force must step in, to reform.

Seculare, even kings already, complain thatthey have no power

As of old it was a great error in Pope Silvester to accept
secular property at the hands of Constantine, and thereby to do harm
to the Church which had flourished splendidly before endowment; so
now'the secularized (Wyclif calls it the “imperialized'’) Church must
be deprived of wotdly goods.

ln many of his sermons Wyclif returns to the need ol this
deprivation and the method of effecting it. Equally often he speaks
about the mischief of endowments.

ll will suffice to mention here only a few passages: Human
reason, Wyclif says, cannot comprehend how such a pretate, burdened
with earthly property, is capable of vanquishing the world and making
himself an example of his teaching3 ns Holy Scripture, reason, and
experience confirm, that the occupatiori of the man with earthly
property, makes him incapable to take hold of what is spiritual, and
to teach the pcople after the commandment of love. ll ever holy
meu accepted earthly goods, perhaps believing that they might easily
distribute to the poor all that was beyond their needs‚ they have
erred, though unconsciously, and probably repented of their error.
Out ol this minor sin grew the deadly sin, which lias now infected
