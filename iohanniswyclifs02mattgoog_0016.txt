own order (those, namely, who desire to lree themselves from the
rule); secondly because they rain many people by their lies, slandering
as heretics the faithful who teach the truth concerning the Eucharist;
of what they themselves are ignorant; thirdly in persecuting with
pernicious hatred simple priests. Therelore it is time lor the secular
lords to put an end to them, and so Grosseteste is right in scourging
the monstrosities ol these friars, who pretend their inventions to be
dogmas ol the Church. Their lips are stained by lying, and their
hands by human blood, and so they are indeed sons ol Caim (Cain),
as even the name ol Cairn (Cain) indicates, in which C stands for
the Carmelites, A the Augustines, l the Jacobites (Dominicans) and
M the Minor friars. From this Cain's tribe, may the Lord deliver us.¹

As concerns the begging ol the friars, the argument is a diabolical
one, which the Pope ought to be asharned to use, that because Paul
in one instance collected earthly goods for the Saints in Jerusalem,
these “sturdy'' lriars may habitually beg for themselves, or: ll the
laithlul minister necessaries ol lile to their preacbers, the people may
bestow large property on the mendicant friam, or finally: ll the
apostle ate amongst the heathen what was convenient to him, so also
these friars may institute observances ol their own in eating and
drinking. But from the Gospel we learn that the “poor’' blind, the
“poor'' lame, arrd the “poor” wealt, were supported by the Apostle. lt
was neither lor himself nor for the rich that he begged.

He chose rather to eam his bread by the worlr olbis hands; and
so these able-bodied beggars should live on the worlt of their hands,
and not be burdensome to their countries which they considerably wealten,
as they do England, by depriving it ol hands and ol much money.²

The lriars are not allowed to tell the truth, as many ol the
more educated amongst them confess. lt is often said: “A monk
out ol cloister is like a writhing fish out ol water.'’ But how is it,
that so many ol them live out ol the cloister, and meddle with
worldly affairs, but in ecclesiastical matters tbey are either silent like
idiots, or disseminate new heresies. Like the minstrels or buffoons
they make their way into houses, and eat up the property ol tlre
poor, without doing them any reciprocal service, as even the minstrels du.
