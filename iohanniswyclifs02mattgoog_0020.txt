INTRODUCTION. XVII

a dotation of worldly property is the more dangerous, that their race
never can die out.¹

From all this follows, that, if any exactionis made by the clergy,
the believer should ask himself first, whether this demand be founded
in Holy Scripture. To secular lords nobody paid tribute more willingly
than Christ the Lord‚ and so should also the clergy do. Then secular
lords would not be obliged to pillage the poor in order to invade
foreign countries; they could rather receive from the clergy the necessary
support against their enemies. As the ecclesiastical property belongs
to the poor of Eugland, it consequently cannot be given to foreigners‚
be it the Pope or the cardinals dcc. And of all these evils existing in
the Church, the laymen too are guilty.²

He himself has very often reproved them for their folly iu
enriching the clergy, contrary to Christ's doctrine and example³

On the judgment day, neither their reputation, nor the delusive
favour in which they are held by the prelates‚ would help them in
any way.

ln numerous passages the secular lords are exhorted to fulfil
, their duties towards monachism by withdrawing their endowment to
· them and by depriving them of worldly property.

Although Wyclif does not advise direct violence, as it was
practised by some of the Hussites,⁴ the failure to exercise the royal
power against the monis, is severely blamed,⁵ and occasionally he
refers to self-help, to which the faithful might be forced by certain
circumstances. ⁰

The combat against monachism and the hierarchy throws the
other questions treated by Wyclif into the back ground.

Very often he explains, but less methodically than in the first
part of the sermons, how the priest should fulfil the duties of his
office. Dogmatic questions are touched upon only here and there.
