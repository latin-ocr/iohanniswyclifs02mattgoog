INTRODUCTION.

“The poor may rejoice, for never did anyone accept poverty
out of greater love than Christ. Lastly, those men may rejoice who
are placed in respect of worldly goods between these tayo conditions
because Christ, living io the state most worthy of honour, scorned
to beg, and molested neither rich nor poor.

But the rich may be ashamed who protect Antichrist and
endow him with earthly wealth; the hypocrites may be ashamed‚
who blasphemously declare that Christ begged; and finally, men of
the middle rank may be ashamed, who consent to the treacherous
robberies of Antichrist.’'

Antichrist is no other than the Pope, and he is called so not
conditionally, as in numerous other worlrs of Wyclif, but absolutely.

As in this first Sermon, so in all those that follow, we find
fierce attacks upon the Papacy with its following of priests, and upon
the begging friars in particular.

ln the same Sermon we read: ln the Bible no sanction can be
found for the Pope with his worldly-minded clergy and 311 the private
sects which are invented newa-days. They must be destroyed, if by
any word they contravene the laws or the works of the Saviour.¹
And as the Pope is called Antichrist here and in numerous other
passages,² so also is his law antichristian.

Three laws, Wyclif says, govern the state; the divine, the papal
or antichristian, and the imperial or civil law.³ The two latter are not
valid, if they are not founded on the first. A man’s reputation, it
is said in another passage, depends upon the righteousness of his life,
and its agreement with the requirements of lloly Scripture, and not
upon the publication of Antichrist’s false Bulls which are commonly
produced by lying tale-bearers.

trarlantur in aliquo verbo onlinacioni vel sactis tam amabilis veritatis. ² nnti-
