As the sect of those friars and their “monstrous'' rule is not
founded in Scripture,¹ so also the vow which the monk must take is
without scriptum foundation. With “apish'' craftiness some friars
argue, that their sect resided on the mount of Carmel everi before
the incarnation of Christ, because Elias found there some imitators.
And by similar hair-splitting, others conclude, that they are brothers

which they are dispensed tomorrow, and this by a man of whom
they know not, whether he be Antichrist.

Once the Lord’s soldiery was stained by the blood of martyrdom,³
now-adays unbridled greed after worldly goods reigns so much
