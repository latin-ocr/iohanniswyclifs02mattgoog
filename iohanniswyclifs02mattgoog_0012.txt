INTRODUCTION. IX

strengthened the faithful in the difficulties of their light. lf a prelata
orders what is against the law of Christ, he is no believer.¹ ll an
inferior is ordered the like, he must resist in humility (humiliter
rebellare).

ll two prelates, one superior, the other inferior, order, the first
must be obeyed, in reasonable things. Now Christ is superior to any
prelate, and can order nothing but what is reasonable. Consequently,
one must resist everything which a pope or prelate orders contrary
to Christ. He who acts otherwise sins grievously.² One can be saved
moreover, without being obedient to such a prelute, lor he helps a
man only by ordering what leads to obedience to Christ.

The mouks, above all, should consider whether they did not
enter an order, when they might have been led by the rule ol Christ.
lf their chief should be a reprobate or ignorant, they may untie the
loolish bonds and live according to the rule of Christ, the common
abbot.³ That prelate will not sin against the rights of the Church,
who contents himself with mean food and clothing‚ and does not
clamour so violently for offerings and tithes, as is done now-a-days,
under pretence ol delending the rights of the chamut Truly apostolic
men are treated in these days as were once the apostles. They are
not allowed to confess the truth ol Christ's religion. The worldly-
· minded prelatos, who are worldly lords themselves, and servants ol
Antichrist‚ seize hold ol such men, and deal with them according to
lrivolous laws.⁵ The mendicant lriars do the most ,injury to the
Church. This leads us to the main topic ol these sermons, i. e. the
attack on the mendicant friars.

Wyclil first arraigns the orders for the numerous improprieties
which disfigure them. He blames them for the envy and spite which
they entertain, not only against strangam, but even against members
ol the orders; he blames their unrestrained love ol worldly amusements,
their debaucheries and their greed ol worldly gain, and lays stress
on the lact of their being given to lying. ln numerous but scattered
passages, where he spealrs about orders, he proves, that the orders
are superfluous, that the common order, to which they all belong,
is the Christian order, and that Christ’s law is lar more sufficient
