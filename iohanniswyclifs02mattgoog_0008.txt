INTRODUCTION. V

Neither can such a Butl justify anyone3 it condemns rather -
like a diabolical writing against the truth — both those in whose
favour it is issued and the bearer.

Antichrist sends his Rulls into the different countries, with the
order that none should presume to dispute them. ln accordance with
this,¹ the cardinals are called the auxiliaries of Antichrist.

What is required, Wyclif asks in one Sermon, in order to become
Pope? Those laws are not needful (ll. 29) which are given only by men.

Christ and the Apostles ordained prelates without such laws.

There is no reason extant, for making such laws, in addition to
the Bible. The institutione made by Christ long before there were
any papal statutes, sufficed for the election of Prelates, and so it
should be still. To be a servant of the Church requires the divine
mission, the power, and the knowledge, which God grente for such
an office.

Such a servant must renounce the world.

Now-a·days indeed, such a bishop, not burdened with earthly
goods, would be sarcastically called a bishop of Nowhere or· episcopus
Nullatensis.

The power of the keys, given to open the gates of the kingdom
of heaven, is used now to extort money, and to obtain a power which
is not founded on the Bible.

The election of the apostle Matthew may serve as a model for
the election of a Pope: They elected two holy men, each fit for the
office, and prayed fervently to God for His decision.

Now they elect alter a statute of their own, and if only a
syllable of it is violated, the election is void, even if the fittest man
has been chosen. Hence come the schisms in the Church, so that
men do not know who is the right Pope, and it would be best to
do without both Popes. A great number of the faithful, we read iu
one passage, blasphemously take the Pope for a god, because what
God has considered sufficient in order to a man's becoming a worthy
