INTRODUCTION. XXI

public mind was excited by these sermons of Wyclif,¹ and inflamed
with hatred for many decades against the prelates and moulrs. The
effect of these sermons must have been the greater, that they were
taken by many for sermons of Hus‚ as is evident from the marginal
notes of our Ms. D.

How they acted on the Bohemian people at large is testified
by the murderiog of the monks‚ the destruction ol the most renowned
churches and cloisters‚ which ensued in Bohemia alter the days of
August 1419, and thoroughly transformed the ecclesiastica} relations
of that country: events which were felt in their consequences sor long
afterwards.

2. The transmission in MSS.

The sermons of this volume have been preserved in three MSS„
namely the Codex of Trinity College, Cambridge (A), the Codex pal.
Vindobonensis 3928 (D), and the Codex pal. Vindobonensis 3931 (E).

These three MSS. have already been described in the introduction
to the first volume.² lt need only be mentioned here, that the 60th
sermon (page 445 to 452) is missing in both MSS.D and E, and two
other sermons which in the fourth part of Ms. Α occur as numbers
2 and rr are inserted in its place.

As sermons 27, 28, 31, 32 and 33 embrace the'whole contents

of the treatise De Sex Jugis, the Ms. of this treatise also (printed by
Lechler, Appendix ll, 591 seqq.) was examined‚ and from its various
readings some improvements have been incorporated into the text.

3. The date and the edition.

About the date ol the composition of this volume all details
have been given iu the introduction to the first volume, and l have
nothing to add either to it, or to the principles which have guided
me in editiug.

On the other hand l feel myself bound to express my heartiest
thanlrs to the founder of the Society Dr. F. l. Furnivall and to
